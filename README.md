This site is a Mini Project that came in my mind,
In this site you will find the "Best" gear in Helldivers II (weapons,stratagems and some good loadouts).

## How I will choose them:

##### I dont plan to test every weapon, </br>
##### I will pick the Weapons based on a simple calculation(*) and Community Favourites.

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stratagems_%3A-red)
#####  This part is a bit tricky since we don't have the damage values but I will choose the Stratagems that are less likely to kill
#####  your teammates Coff! Coff! "Mortars" and that do good damage or have a good utility. This will basicly useless since it depends
#####  if you are fighthing the Bugs or the Automatons but can be a good choice if you dont know what to choose or if you don't want to use
#####  the loadouts.

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Loadouts_%3A-yellow)</br>
#####  Basicly will be divided by 3 Tiers (LOW < MEDIUM < HIGH) based on the LVL/RANK that you need to unlock the items needed. I want to</br> 
##### have 3 Tiers with 3 types of PlayStyle (Light | Adjustable | Tank )
